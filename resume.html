<h2>PROJECT</h2>
<hr>
<h3>COMPACT MULTIBAND PIFA ANTENNA FOR ENHANCED V2X COMMUNICATION</h3>
<h3>description:</h3>Designed and simulated a miniaturized Planar Inverted-F Antenna (PIFA) optimized for multi-band operation (1.86–10 GHz, 11.5–15 GHz, 16.2–19 GHz) to support V2X communication using Ansys HFSS.
Integrated Defected Ground Structures (DGS), circular/rectangular slots, and a tuned air gap to achieve wider bandwidth, improved impedance matching, and VSWR < 2 across all bands.
Achieved maximum gain of 7.7 dB at 5.9 GHz, enabling reliable DSRC, C-V2X, Wi-Fi 6E, and automotive connectivity.
Conducted performance validation via S11, VSWR, radiation pattern, gain plots, and surface current analysis, demonstrating superior performance over comparable designs.
